# event-map

my attempt to visualize events on a map

inspired by [Charles Joseph Minard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard)'s visualization of the movements of La Grande Armée

Napoleonic Wars dataset from [borealisdata](https://borealisdata.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5683/SP3/HIWRLX), under [CC-BY 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0)

## setup

> bun install
> bun dev

This runs this prototype locally, then use chrome to visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/)

## TODO

Please excuse the arcs all over the map, those are Napoleons movements (some are missing because the dataset is incomplete). I plan to animate them over time.
